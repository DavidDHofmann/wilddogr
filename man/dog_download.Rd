\title{Download GPS data from Dropbox}
\usage{
dog_download(x, overwrite = F, clean = F, outdir = getwd(), printpath = T)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{data.frame (or a subset of it) as returned from \code{dog_files()}
containing the files you'd like to download. If you simply want to download
all files, consider using \code{dog_download_all()}.}

\item{overwrite}{logical indicating if you wish to overwrite already existing
files}

\item{clean}{logical indicating if you wish to pre-process the data}

\item{outdir}{character directory where you'd like to store the downloaded
files. By default this is set to your working directory (i.e. \code{getwd()})}

\item{printpath}{should the path to the final file(s) be returned after the
operations are finished?}
}
\value{
character filepath to the downloaded files
}
\description{
This function allows you to download the files you subsetted using
\code{dog_files()}. Files can either be downloaded in their raw format (as
they are on Dropbox) using \code{clean = F}. Alternatively, the files can be
pre-processed using \code{clean = T}. This will: (1) make sure all files are
converted to .csv files with the same separator, (2) special characters such
as 'Â°' are removed, (3) a column is indicating if an individual was
dispersing or resident is added, (4) collar handling periods are removed, (5)
perfect duplicates are removed, (6) unnecessary columns are removed, (6) all
files are finally merged into a single .csv file.

# Randomly select three of the files
files <- files[sample(nrow(files), 3), ]
